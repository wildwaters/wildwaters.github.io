If you see any errors, please let me know.\nDue Date: Paper 10/24; Participation before, during, and after trip\nThis assignment involves participation in and reflection on an excursion to the Madawaska River, where we will learn about the history and geography of the region while camping on the river bank and taking white water skills instruction. Final dates of the trip have been set for Oct 12-14.\nPlease make sure to read and fill out the trip documents package! You\u0026rsquo;ll want to print pages 11-17 at leasst. Please note that the \u0026ldquo;Trip Leader\u0026rdquo; form on pp.18-19 is provided for information purposes only \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ll be signing that myself :-)\nFor planning purposes \u0026amp; job signup, please use the Google Docs Spreadsheet designed for this purpose. We\u0026rsquo;ll also try to do some oc-ordination through the Canvas forums.\nRequirements Your mark on this assignment is determined as follows:\n \u0026frac12; participation \u0026frac12; written reflection  Let\u0026rsquo;s look at each of these in more detail.\nParticipation This is a group activity whose success depends on your active and meaningful participation in preparation, execution, and debriefing.\nFor our purposes, \u0026ldquo;active and meaningful participation\u0026rdquo; includes:\n Contributing substantively to the pre-trip planning process, e.g.:  filling out the gear and task spreadsheet in in a timely fashion executing your logistical tasks in a friendly and effective manner participating in on- and off-line discussions regarding gear, rendezvous points, etc.  Fulfilling the requirements of both your trip jobs (\u0026ldquo;logistical\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;intellectual\u0026rdquo;)  in particular, your \u0026ldquo;intellectual job\u0026rdquo; should add substantively to the group\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the Madawaska River and the trip itself  Active Listening: paying attention throughout the trip, asking appropriate questions both during technical instruction and in group meetings, engaging in discussion, sharing comments, demonstrating interest and enthusiasm (this includes body language), exercising critical thinking, note taking, entertaining contradictory perspectives, engaging and acknowledging hosts’ presence. Involvement in Group Discussion: sharing knowledge and information, challenging yourself to speak up if you usually don’t, and allowing others to speak if you are a person who tends to dominate discussions Group Accountability: participating positively as part of a group during all activities. Respect: interacting in a culturally appropriate manner with hosts and local communities while traveling. Engagement: you are expected to work hard at technical skills and follow instruction, and also to participate in camp-making and camp-breaking activities, as well as cooking, dishwashing, etc. Surveys: completion of pre- and post-trip surveys is mandatory and, while your responses will be anonymized, your response or non-response will be noted. Peer Appreciation: You\u0026rsquo;ll be asked to highlight one significant contribution made by each member of your group.  Your participation mark is not meant to reflect your technical proficiency at the end of the whitewater course \u0026ndash; though your effort in the technical instruction will e taken into account.\nEvaluation will be based on instructor notes taken during the excursion.\nReflection Paper Write a paper of ~1000 words (no more than 1250) in which you take one aspect of your experience on the Madawaska as the starting point for an exploration of themes related to the course.\nWhat is a reflection paper? By reflection paper, I mean a piece of argumentative writing that takes thoughtful reflection on your own experience as the starting point and immediate evidentiary basis for an engagement with course readings and themes. In this case, you might choose any of several lines of inquiry:\n risk and pedagogy: Both Beames \u0026amp; Brown and Brown discuss the literature on risk in outdoor education (or what Beames \u0026amp; Brown call \u0026ldquo;adventurous education\u0026rdquo;). You might take this opportunity to reflect on the sensation of risk (physical, social, emotional ,etc.) and how it affected your experience of the trip, and the overall learning outcomes. river histories: here there are several angles you might take. We\u0026rsquo;ve read a little bit about river economies, about cultural practices around rivers, and about experiences of the sacred. Do your experiences on the trip give you insight into any of those questions?  Marking criteria As with any written assignment, I mark on the basis of the following criteria:\n Thesis, Argument and Evidence: Is it clear what you are arguing for? Do your arguments \u0026ldquo;cohere\u0026rdquo;, that is, are they self-consistent? Does the evidence you bring forward actually support your claims? Style and Grammar: Do your phrasing and sentence structure make it easy (even fun) to understand your arguments, or do they get in the way? Do you make frequent grammatical errors? Spelling and Citations: Do you make frequent typographical errors? Have you used a consistent citation style such as Chicago Manual of Style, MLA, or APA?  For a reflection paper, I add the following:\n does the paper display some sense of the appropriate scope of arguments from experience? That is, do you seem to understand both the limits of reflection (e.g., the difficulty of generalizing from a single person\u0026rsquo;s experience) and its specific epistemic virtues (e.g., the strong power of analogy and empathy to craft meaningful narratives)?  An A or excellent paper will be clear, concise, well-organized and thoughtful. It will in general include supporting evidence, be divided logically into paragraphs, have minimal spelling and grammatical errors, and will be of appropriate length. A B paper will share those virtues but to a lesser degree. A C paper will be missing some of these virtues. A D or F paper will lack many of them.\nCitations Note on citations: I don\u0026rsquo;t care what citation style you use, but you should use it properly and consistently. I very strongly recommend the use of a citation manager, such as Zotero. It will not make much difference for this class, but over the next few years it will save you an enormous amount of work. You may in any case want to join the river project library, which will give you access to a large number of sources.\nSubmission Please submit your work both by email and by Quercus (this instruction may change if I figure out a better method later i n the semester).\n use an editable format, such as .doc, .docx, or .odt. Despite their many limitations, these formats are excellent for review and commenting. Include your name somewhere in the file. I need to be able to keep track of which paper is whose! Please do not include your student number in the paper.

Beames \u0026amp; Brown 2016), but a feature of many parts of our experience: physical, social, emotional, etc. In a brief statement or essay of no more than 300 words, describe the various risks involved in a trip such as \u0026ldquo;Encountering the Madawaska,\u0026rdquo; foregrounding those you think are most serious.\nLearning Goals One often-repeated risk management principle for outdoor educators is that risks should be taken only where they contribute directly to the learning outcomes of the experience (or, phrased differently, to the mission of the organization). What goals have you set yourself for this trip (or, if you are unable to attend, what goals would you set for yourself if you were to come)? Answer in no more than 200 words.\nPersonal Risk Mitigation Strategy How can you personally minimize unnecessary risk, and optimize the outcome in any risky situation you encounter, while simultaneously attaining the goals stated above? Again, answer in approximately 200 words.\nGroup Risk Mitigation What responsibilities lie not with you, but with your instructors? What can you expect from Prof. Price and your guides? Can your enhance the learning outcomes for the group as a whole? Another 200 words\nThis assignment asks you to think about the risks and learning outcomes associated with our upcoming excursion.\nSubmission Answer all the above questions in a .docx or .odt document (to allow me to comment). For now, please submit your work twice:\n once via Quercus once via email to me  I\u0026rsquo;ll work on a more streamlined process as I get to know Quercus better.\n","tags":null,"title":"Encountering the Madawaska: Personal Risk Mitigation Plan","uri":"https://wildwater.github.io/assignment/risk-assessment/"},{"categories":null,"content":" Your participation mark is substantial (20%) and reflects the unusual nature of the seminar. The mark has two components:\n Each week at the start of class, you will hand in a piece of paper with a short quote from the readings and an accompanying question about the text. The question may (or may not) be used to as a discussion prompt for the class. During course discussions, you will be expected to participate actively. This means listening carefully to your classmates; responding thoughtfully to their comments; posing questions of your own, while being careful not to dominate the conversation unnecessarily.  Both of these tasks require you to do the reading and pay attention to lecture, and to do so critically \u0026ndash; that is, with attention both to what is being said and to what may be left out or misrepresented.\nHow to create a discussion question Formulate a good discussion question that will be interesting to other students and call for some thinking about the reading. Try also to find a question that genuinely interests you. The following are characteristics of a good discussion question:\n A discussion question cannot be answered yes or no. A discussion question cannot be answered with a fact. A discussion question should not require a personal opinion outside the reading. A discussion questions should redirect the discussion to the reading itself. A discussion question should ask the discussants to explain the author\u0026rsquo;s meaning and not simply quote the author or authors. A discussion question should indicate that the person who posed the question is actually curious about the answer. A discussion question should be answerable with evidence from the reading and common information that has preceded it in the course. A discussion question should permit several interpretations. In other words, it should be rich enough to offer several possible directions in its answers.

Please feel free to file any questions about the course as issues (unless you\u0026rsquo;re a student in the course, in which case please ask me through the official channels!).\n","tags":null,"title":"About This Site","uri":"https://wildwater.github.io/article/about/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","tags":null,"title":"Articles","uri":"https://wildwater.github.io/article/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","tags":null,"title":"Assignments","uri":"https://wildwater.github.io/assignment/"},{"categories":null,"content":"","tags":null,"title":"Categories","uri":"https://wildwater.github.io/categories/"},{"categories":null,"content":"This is a list of terms from the readings that seemed particularly enigmatic to me when I first encountered them.

Like a river itself, the course meanders, rushes, then slows, ebbs and flows.\nWe have two main objectives. First, we are motivated by a set of theoretical and methodological questions. What exactly is a \u0026ldquo;river\u0026rdquo;? How have rivers shaped the course of history on both local and global scales? What contributions have rivers made to \u0026ldquo;culture\u0026rdquo; (and what exactly do we mean by that term; and, again, on both local and global scales)? What values do rivers impose on us, or rather, what might we learn from rivers and river cultures about how we ought to live?\nSecond, this course is an engagement with an emergent set of practices and theories around experiential education. What can we learn from mixing our reading and writing with \u0026ldquo;embodied practices\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; that is, with practical engagements that bring us into close contact with river waters? How do experiences of paddling in, walking along, and even sleeping beside rivers transform and deepen our understanding of them? In this semester we explore these questions through a weekend-long \u0026ldquo;immersive educational experience\u0026rdquo; (IEE) which takes place outside of our regular class meetings. During this weekend \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Encountering the Madawaska\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss the history of North Ontario rivers, while learning practical canoe skills with the assistance of professional guides. We\u0026rsquo;ll finish the weekend with a trip down one of Ontario\u0026rsquo;s classic whitewater waterways. This excursion is not mandatory, but it is perhaps the most exciting opportunity that the course offers, and you are strongly encouraged to take part if at all possible. The IEE will contribute to your final mark; students who are unable to participate will be required to complete an alternative assignment.\nWith some luck, and pending some administrative decisions, we may also have a special opportunity during reading week. Watch this space.\nWeekly classroom session follow a mixed lecture-discussion format; an initial lecture will generally precede a class discussion about the readings and, in some cases, auxiliary topics. The IEE will involve substantial physical activity but also class discussions and informal lectures.\nObjectives  Learn how rivers are defined and classified by natural and social scientists Become conversant with the main social and cultural questions surrounding the study of rivers Understand the role of rivers in water rights and water justice issues in Canada today, including the role of water in Indigenous rights movements Develop an ethical framework for thinking about water and rivers Experiment with immersive experiential education Develop a habit of contemplation and inquiry into your own role in your education  Academic Integrity In keeping with the University’s policy toward plagiarism and cheating, academic misconduct in this course will be taken seriously and will result in disciplinary action (see the Code of Student Conduct and Code of Behavior on Academic Matters for what counts as an offence). In essence, to take credit in any way for work that is not your own without acknowledging the source(s) counts as plagiarism and cheating. If you are still unsure as to what counts as plagiarism and also want to know specific ways to avoid it, you should study this page.\nAccessibility Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. In particular, if you have a disability or health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach me and/or the Accessibility Services Office as soon as possible. The Accessibility Services staff are available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let them and me know your needs, the quicker we can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course. All of the above applies with redoubled urgency to our proposed class trip to the Madawaska River.\nCourse Requirements and Grading Note September 2018: this remains subject to change until after our first class meeting. Until that time, please consider this a guideline only.\nCourse assignments are described in detail in the Assignments section of the website (though details will not all be available on the first day of class). They consist of the following:\n Class Participation: this is a vital part of our small seminar; please see the Participation web page for details. Risk Assessment/Learning Objectives: A short, formal assignment in advance of \u0026ldquo;Encountering the Madawaska\u0026rdquo;. Worth 10% Encountering the Madawaska: In some ways, this assignment is the heart of the course. We will spend two full days in an outdoor environment learning whitewater canoeing skills and traversing rapids on the Madawaska River, a tributary of the Ottawa in Eastern Ontario. While there, we will also hold seminar sessions, cook and eat together, and engage in all the normal practices of a camping excursion. After the event, you\u0026rsquo;ll be asked to complete a short written assignment. See the web page for more details. Students who are unable to attend will be asked to complete an alternative assignment. Response Papers: Two short (3-4 page) response papers, worth 10% each. Questions will be provided at least one week in advance. Final \u0026ldquo;Exam\u0026rdquo;: A take-home exercise in which you will be asked to respond to several questions with an essay-like response. Questions will be handed out in advance, but marking will treat responses similarly to those found in an exam paper.
