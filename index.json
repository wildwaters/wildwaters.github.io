[{"categories":null,"content":" Presentation: March 26\nPaper: Due April 6\nGiven the small class and the relatively short time we\u0026rsquo;ve had to discuss the magnificent Ganga/Ganges river, let\u0026rsquo;s devote our final projects to this fascinating stream. A long river but by no means the longest, when combined with the Brahmaputra the Ganges has the third-largest discharge of any river in the world. It flows largely East-West across the Northern Indian plains, fed by Himalayan glacial outflow, and in our class we will explore various aspects of its cultural history. For this assignment, you should pick one narrow aspect of the Ganges and explore it first in a brief in-class presentation, and second in a mid-length (7-10 pp) research paper.\nGeneral Guidelines Your job is to extend your own knowledge and that of your classmates by learning something new about one aspect of the river. Even if your research overlaps with your classmates\u0026rsquo;, you will likely bring a fresh perspective and a specific focus. Some obvious topic areas are:\n the sacredness of the Ganges: what does the Ganges mean to Hindus, and what can we learn about the nature of belief by examining the river? hydropower: what political and cultural issues are made visible by the conflicts around hydroelectric damming along the Ganges \u0026amp; its tributaries? pollution: similarly, by studying pollution on the Ganges, can we learn about the nature of modern life, about conflicts between environmental and human flourishing, or perhaps something specific about the meaning of the \u0026ldquo;sacred\u0026rdquo; in contemporary India?  Presentation Prepare a short presentation on your topic area for the class. 10-15 minutes is probably more than sufficient. A slide-based presentation will probably be best. Introduce your topic area to the class, spend the bulk of your time discussing details of the issue, and close with a hint at the thesis you might be interested in pursuing for your paper. Move form the general to the concrete, but also talk about the wider importance of the issue you\u0026rsquo;re exploring. Grading criteria:\n is your presentation clear and straightforward? Did I learn something from it? Did your peers learn something from it? Are your visual materials helpful and relevant to the presentation? Do you indicate a clear path towards your final paper?  Paper Prepare a short research paper (7-10pp) on a specific topic relevant to the History and/or culture of the Ganges River. The paper should be clear and well-argued, with convincing argument supported by compelling evidence. Your evidence should come largely from works beyond the course readings. A good paper will be relatively free of grammatical and typographical errors, and will apply a consistent style of citation whenever citations are appropriate. For more general guidelines on writing research papers, consider consulting [http://history.utoronto.ca/undergraduate/learn-more/essay-writing-guide][the History Department\u0026rsquo;s guide to essay writing.\n","tags":null,"title":"River Biographies","uri":"http://wildwater.hackinghistory.ca/assignment/river-biographies/"},{"categories":null,"content":" Due Date Updated: Now Due Monday, March 12\nWrite a paper of ~1000 words (no more than 1250) exploring what you learned over the course of Saturday\u0026rsquo;s outing.\nGeneral Guidelines By reflection paper, I mean a piece of argumentative writing that takes thoughtful reflection on your own experience as the starting point and immediate evidentiary basis for an engagement with course readings and themes. In this case, you might choose any of several lines of inquiry:\n living your education: In what ways does learning about the Don, the Humber, and local creeks differ from learning about the distant Mississippi? Does what you learned affect the way you see your day-to-day life in Toronto? ways of knowing: The two halves of our outing were led by guides with very different perspectives on the lost rivers of Toronto. What kinds of knowledge does each guide bring to bear? How does this affect what lessons we can draw from the tour? river histories: here there are several angles you might take. We\u0026rsquo;ve read a little bit about river economies, about cultural practices around rivers, and (to a much lesser extent) about experiences of the sacred. Do your experiences on the trip give you insight into any of those questions?  Marking criteria As with any written assignment, I mark on the basis of the following criteria:\n Thesis, Argument and Evidence: Is it clear what you are arguing for? Do your arguments \u0026ldquo;cohere\u0026rdquo;, that is, are they self-consistent? Does the evidence you bring forward actually support your claims? Style and Grammar: Do your phrasing and sentence structure make it easy (even fun) to understand your arguments, or do they get in the way? Do you make frequent grammatical errors? Spelling and Citations: Do you make frequent typographical errors? Have you used a consistent citation style such as Chicago Manual of Style, MLA, or APA?  For a reflection paper, I add the following:\n does the paper display some sense of the appropriate scope of arguments from experience? That is, do you seem to understand both the limits of reflection (e.g., the difficulty of generalizing from a single person\u0026rsquo;s experience) and its specific epistemic virtues (e.g., the strong power of analogy and empathy to craft meaningful narratives)?  An A or excellent paper will be clear, concise, well-organized and thoughtful. It will in general include supporting evidence, be divided logically into paragraphs, have minimal spelling and grammatical errors, and will be of appropriate length. A B paper will share those virtues but to a lesser degree. A C paper will be missing some of these virtues. A D or F paper will lack many of them.\nCitations Note on citations: I don\u0026rsquo;t care what citation style you use, but you should use it properly and consistently. I very strongly recommend the use of a citation manager, such as Zotero. It will not make much difference for this class, but over the next few years it will save you an enormous amount of work. You may in any case want to join the river project library, which will give you access to a large number of sources.\nSubmission Please submit your work by email.\n use an editable format, such as .doc, .docx, or .odt. Despite their many limitations, these formats are excellent for review and commenting. Include your name somewhere in the file. I need to be able to keep track of which paper is whose!

Usually response papers work best when framed either as a disagreement with, or an expansion of, the original author\u0026rsquo;s ideas. So, for instance, here are two ways one might respond to Plato\u0026rsquo;s Allegory of the Cave:\n While Plato argues convincingly that we have no direct access to the material world, his cave metaphor ultimately fails. In particular, I will argue that there is simply no way that the captive observers could be adequately fed without coming to understand that the world has 3 dimensions and that they are imprisoned within it. This has important consequences for any version of Idealism that seeks to ground itself in Plato\u0026rsquo;s work.\n or\n One puzzling aspect of Plato\u0026rsquo;s remarkably successful and almost wholly convincing account of the Cave has to do with the manner in which a captive observer would escape and bring the news of an extenral world to his or her fellow prisoners. In this paper, drawing on the work of David Copperfield and Harry Houdini, I will outline the precise steps required to effect such an escape. I\u0026rsquo;ll show how a more precise understanding radically deepens our understanding of the human predicament and has broad consequences for a theory of underlying reality and the relationship between the world of Forms and the world of mere phenomena.\n A response paper has several important components:\n Understanding of the Text: The paper should show familiarity with the source text and present a reasonable interpretations of one or more of its arguments Point of Departure: Your paper should make it quite clear where your own thinking departs from that of the original author Compelling Argument: Your main points should be well-supported with evidence from the text and elsewhere, and with argumentative tissue that connects the evidence to your claims.  It\u0026rsquo;s also important to attend to spelling, grammar, etc., but these are less crucial than the above.\nQuestions The truth of Anishinaabe power On p. 7 of his magesterial An Infinity of Nations, Michael Witgen tells us that\n The truth of Anishinaabe power and independence is revealed in various Anishinaabe encounters with officials and missionaries recorded by men such as Schoolcraft, Allen, and Boutwell. These men, however, could not comprehend the Native New World that the Anishinaabeg had crated for themselves in the two centuries since their first encounter with the peoples of the Old World.\n How does Witgen\u0026rsquo;s account of the rise of Anishinaabe power around the Great Lakes change your view of the American expansion into the West in the 18th and 19th centuries? Do you have any reservations about this new narrative? What are they?\nEnding an Error The authors of \u0026ldquo;The End of an Error\u0026rdquo; write:\n The devastating experience of New Orleans teaches us that, particularly when we are dealing with complex natural-and-social systems that we do not yet fully understand, we need to be quicker to question the conviction that a project will be “economically vital,” or that environmental and subsequent human damage are “not to be feared.” We need to build our capacity to recognize the potential significance of the harms, as well as the benefits, that we now have the capacity to bring into being—and we need to do a better job of avoiding the kinds of decisions that may prove impossible to undo.\n In light of this and other readings about pollution and disaster o n the Mississippi, what kinds of policies do you think the Mississippi needs? How should human and ecological interestes be weighted? To what extent are these in conflict with each other?\n\u0026ldquo;The Trouble with Whiteness\u0026rdquo; Stephanie le Menager opens her provocative \u0026ldquo;Floating Capital\u0026rdquo; with the following observation:\n For Twain, the North American West had not been about the political disinterest, domestic economy, and republican virtue long associated with agricultural settlement, from eighteenth-century European agrarian philosophy through Thomas Jefferson. The Mississippi River was the West that Twain returned to, again and again, because it was water and not land that could ever be settled. The river was a carrier of economic desire and troubled commodities that flowed beyond continental spaces, suturing the U.S. to global networks of capital\u0026hellip; Twain\u0026rsquo;s classic river novel [is] a profound, postnational critique of white mobility on the western frontier.\n There\u0026rsquo;s a lot going on in these brief sentences. Choose one of le Menager\u0026rsquo;s themes \u0026ndash; trade; economic imagination (dreams of wealth, visions of economic disparity); race relations and visions of America\u0026rsquo;s whiteness \u0026ndash; and make your own argument about its appearance in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. What do you learn about American society and/or Americans\u0026rsquo; views of themselves from reading Huck Finn? Support your argument with citations from Huck Finn, and feel free to use le Menager\u0026rsquo;s arguments as well.\n","tags":null,"title":"Response Paper 1","uri":"http://wildwater.hackinghistory.ca/assignment/response-paper-1/"},{"categories":null,"content":" Your participation mark is substantial (20%) and reflects the unusual nature of the seminar. The mark reflects the following components:\n Attendance: prompt arrival to class meetings and positive presence in class. Active Listening: paying attention during class meetings, asking appropriate questions, engaging in discussion, sharing comments, demonstrating interest and enthusiasm (this includes body language), exercising critical thinking, note taking, entertaining contradictory perspectives, engaging and acknowledging the presence of all participants. Involvement in Group Discussion: sharing knowledge and information, challenging yourself to speak up if you usually don’t, and allowing others to speak if you are a person who tends to dominate discussions. Group Accountability: participating positively as part of a group during all aspects of the course, which includes contributing to the learning of other participants by sharing your own ideas and work. Respect: interacting in a culturally appropriate manner with guest speakers and course participants. See the policies section of the syllabus for more guidance. Questions: at the start of class you will be asked to hand in two thoughtful questions about the week\u0026rsquo;s readings (see the next section for details)  All of these tasks require you to do the reading and pay attention to lectures (such as they are), and to do so critically \u0026ndash; that is, with attention both to what is being said and to what may be left out or misrepresented\nHow to create a discussion question Formulate a good discussion question that will be interesting to other students and call for some thinking about the reading. Try also to find a question that genuinely interests you. The following are characteristics of a good discussion question:\n A discussion question cannot be answered yes or no. A discussion question cannot be answered with a fact. A discussion question should not require a personal opinion outside the reading. A discussion questions should redirect the discussion to the reading itself. A discussion question should ask the discussants to explain the author\u0026rsquo;s meaning and not simply quote the author or authors. A discussion question should indicate that the person who posed the question is actually curious about the answer. A discussion question should be answerable with evidence from the reading and common information that has preceded it in the course. A discussion question should permit several interpretations. In other words, it should be rich enough to offer several possible directions in its answers.

Like a river itself, the course meanders, rushes, then slows, ebbs and flows.\nWe have two main objectives. First, we are motivated by a set of theoretical and methodological questions. What exactly is a \u0026ldquo;river\u0026rdquo;? How have rivers shaped the course of history on both local and global scales? What contributions have rivers made to \u0026ldquo;culture\u0026rdquo; (and what exactly do we mean by that term; and, again, on both local and global scales)? What values do rivers impose on us, or rather, what might we learn from rivers and river cultures about how we ought to live?\nSecond, this course is an engagement with an emergent set of practices and theories around experiential education. What can we learn from mixing our reading and writing with \u0026ldquo;embodied practices\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; that is, with practical engagements that bring us into close contact with river waters? How do experiences of paddling in, walking along, and even sleeping beside rivers transform and deepen our understanding of them? In this semester we explore these questions primarily through a weekend-long \u0026ldquo;immersive educational experience\u0026rdquo; (IEE) which takes place outside of our regular class meetings (next semester we\u0026rsquo;ll do two more). During this weekend \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Encountering the Madawaska\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss the history of North Ontario rivers, while learning practical canoe skills with the assistance of professional guides. We\u0026rsquo;ll finish the weekend with a trip down one of Ontario\u0026rsquo;s classic whitewater waterways. This excursion is not mandatory, but it is perhaps the most exciting opportunity that the course offers, and you are strongly encouraged to take part if at all possible. The IEE will contribute to your final mark; students who are unable to participate will be required to complete an alternative assignment.\nWeekly classroom session follow a mixed lecture-discussion format; an initial lecture will generally precede a class discussion about the readings and, in some cases, auxiliary topics. The IEE will involve substantial physical activity but also class discussions and informal lectures.\nObjectives  Learn how rivers are defined and classified by natural and social scientists Become conversant with the main social and cultural questions surrounding the study of rivers Understand the role of rivers in water rights and water justice issues in Canada today, including the role of water in Indigenous rights movements Develop an ethical framework for thinking about water and rivers Experiment with immersive experiential education Develop a habit of contemplation and inquiry into your own role in your education  Academic Integrity In keeping with the University’s policy toward plagiarism and cheating, academic misconduct in this course will be taken seriously and will result in disciplinary action (see the Code of Student Conduct and Code of Behavior on Academic Matters for what counts as an offence). In essence, to take credit in any way for work that is not your own without acknowledging the source(s) counts as plagiarism and cheating.

The Accessibility Services staff are available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let them and me know your needs, the quicker we can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course. All of the above applies with redoubled urgency to our proposed class trip to the Madawaska River.\nCourse Requirements and Grading Course assignments are described in detail in the Assignments section of the website (though details may not all be available on the first day of class). They consist of the following:\n Class Participation: this is a vital part of our small seminar; please see the Participation web page for details. Risk Assessment/Learning Objectives: A short, formal assignment in advance of \u0026ldquo;Encountering the Madawaska\u0026rdquo;. Encountering the Madawaska: In some ways, this assignment is the heart of the class. We will spend two full days in an outdoor environment learning whitewater canoeing skills and traversing rapids on the Madawaska River, a tributary of the Ottawa in Eastern Ontario. While there, we will also hold seminar sessions, cook and eat together, and engage in all the normal practices of a camping excursion. After the event, you\u0026rsquo;ll be asked to complete a short written assignment. See the web page for more details. Students who are unable to attend will be asked to complete an alternative assignment. Response Papers: Three short (3-4 page) response papers, worth 15% each.

Course Meetings: Mon 3-5, WE 69    About Wild Water This course is the second in a two-semester sequence exploring the history and culture of rivers \u0026ndash; the \u0026ldquo;wild waters\u0026rdquo; which have played (and continue to play!) a pivotal role in so many of the world\u0026rsquo;s cultures. Like a river itself, these courses meander, rush, then slow, ebb and flow. The first semester provided a broad introduction to the topic, while this second semester will provide opportunities for deeper investigations into two of the great river systems of the world. Your own course projects will provide an opportunity for each of you to explore one more river system through a presentation and research project. We take an interdisciplinary approach to our subject, using rivers as a way to explore historical, cultural, and social questions. How have the Mississippi and the Ganga rivers shaped the course of history and the lives of the people who live around them? What contributions have they made to \u0026ldquo;culture\u0026rdquo;, and what exactly do we mean by that term? What can we learn from the Mississippi, the Ganga, and the lives of the people around them, about how we ought to live?\nThis course is also an engagement with an emergent set of practices and theories around experiential education. What can we learn from mixing our reading and writing with \u0026ldquo;embodied practices\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; that is, with practical engagements that bring us into close contact with river waters? How do experiences of paddling in, walking along, and even sleeping beside rivers transform and deepen our understanding of them? In this semester we explore these questions primarily through two days of exploration of the Humber River, the most prominent and historically important of the Toronto-area waterways. This activity will require two full weekend days; to make up for this extra course time, the course is shortened by two weeks, so our last meeting will be March 12.\nWeekly classroom session follow a mixed lecture-discussion format; an initial lecture will generally precede a class discussion about the readings and, in some cases, auxiliary topics. The Humber trip will involve substantial physical activity but also discussions and presentations from our guides.\nObjectives  Learn integrative approach to the study of river systems Explore the history \u0026amp; cultural geography of the Mississippi and Ganga Rivers Develop research skills around a similar exploration of another historically important river Develop an ethical framework for thinking about water and rivers Experiment with immersive experiential education Develop a habit of contemplation and inquiry into your own role in your education  Policies and Academic Integrity Integrity In keeping with the University’s policy toward plagiarism and cheating, academic misconduct in this course will be taken seriously and will result in disciplinary action (see the Code of Student Conduct and Code of Behavior on Academic Matters for what counts as an offence). In essence, to take credit in any way for work that is not your own without acknowledging the source(s) counts as plagiarism and cheating. If you are still unsure as to what counts as plagiarism and also want to know specific ways to avoid it, you should study this page.\nRespecting Diversity Diverse backgrounds, embodiments, and experiences are essential to the critical thinking endeavor at the heart of higher education. We expect you to be respectful of the many social and cultural differences among us, which may include, but are not limited to: age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity, technical ability, gender identity and presentation, citizenship and immigration status, national origin, race, religious and political beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. Please talk with me right away if you experience disrespect in this class—from any source, including myself—and I will active work to address it.\nCorrespondence Last semester we used the Slack messaging platform for communication; we will discuss in the first meeting whether or not to continue that practice. In the case of questions having to do with official University business (requests for extensions, discussion of accommodations, any message involving sensitive personal data) please use my University email, being sure to put \u0026ldquo;RLG239\u0026rdquo; in the subject line. I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to reply within two working days, though occasionally the delay may be slightly longer. Please allow the full 48 hours to elapse before sending a repeat email.\nAttendance Make every effort to attend each class meeting (including lab sections)! Class will begin and (usually) end on time. Please do your best to get to class before the start of the session. Students are expected to attend all meetings, with exceptions permitted in case of illness and family emergencies.\nPlease silence all cell phones/pagers/etc. before the beginning of each class. You should bring your laptop for in-class work, but please don\u0026rsquo;t use class time (lecture or lab) to check your email, update your Facebook, read reddit, watch YouTube, make dank memes, seize the means of production (allowed), etc. Such usage is distracting and interferes with learning both for you and for all the other students around you. Spend class time on class materials. If another student\u0026rsquo;s activity is distracting, please ask them to stop it (or let me know outside of class).\nAccessibility Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. In particular, if you have a disability or health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach me and/or the Accessibility Services Office as soon as possible. The Accessibility Services staff are available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let them and me know your needs, the quicker we can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course. All of the above applies with redoubled urgency to our proposed class trip to the Madawaska River.\nCourse Requirements and Grading Course assignments are described in detail in the Assignments section of the website (though details will not all be available on the first day of class).

Please Note: Huckleberry Finn uses a number of racial epithets which were already disparaging at the time of publication and are grossly offensive today. I have nonetheless chosen to use the unexpurgated versions, in large part because this racialized language is important to the reception of the book and to any well-informed analysis of it. Please be aware that some of the language in the book may be difficult to stomach, and bring a critical awareness to the text at all times. Le Menager\u0026rsquo;s text should provide a helpful guide to these difficult questions.\nWeek 5 (02/05): Mississippi (Pollution, Race and Injustice in our Times)  Morris, Christopher.
