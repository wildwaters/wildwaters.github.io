      <description>General Guidelines By &amp;ldquo;Response Paper&amp;rdquo;, I mean a brief argumentative essay responding directly to issues raised by course readings. Usually response papers work best when framed either as a disagreement with, or an expansion of, the original author&amp;rsquo;s ideas. So, for instance, here are two ways one might respond to Plato&amp;rsquo;s Allegory of the Cave:

      <description>This Pass/Fail assignment is worth 10% of your final grade, and is due 09/26.
Before completing this assignment, carefully read the Trip Description, as well as Chapter 3 of Beames &amp;amp; Brown, Adventurous Learning, esp. pp. 24-25, 30-33.
Risk Assessment &amp;ldquo;Risk&amp;rdquo; is not only a concept of recent origin (cf. Beames &amp;amp; Brown 2016), but a feature of many parts of our experience: physical, social, emotional, etc. In a brief statement or essay of no more than 300 words, describe the various risks involved in a trip such as &amp;ldquo;Encountering the Madawaska,&amp;rdquo; foregrounding those you think are most serious.</description>

      <description>Your participation mark is substantial (20%) and reflects the unusual nature of the seminar. The mark has two components:
 Each week at the start of class, you will hand in a piece of paper with a short quote from the readings and an accompanying question about the text. The question may (or may not) be used to as a discussion prompt for the class. During course discussions, you will be expected to participate actively.</description>
